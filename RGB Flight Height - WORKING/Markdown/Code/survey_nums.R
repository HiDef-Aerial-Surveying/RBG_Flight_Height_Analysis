# If there were two surveys some months, then the code will need to be slightly different than if there was only one, so here either choose "month" for one survey or "mnsurv" for 2 surveys some months
  #SppDat$mon.var <- SppDat$month
  SppDat$mon.var <- SppDat$mnsurv

  #all.frame$mon.var <- all.frame$month
  all.frame$mon.var <- all.frame$mnsurv
